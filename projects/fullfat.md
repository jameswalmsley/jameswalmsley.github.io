FullFAT was my first major open-source project. It provides a thread-safe implementation of the FAT filesystem as commonly
used in millions of devices today.

FullFAT is the primary FAT implementation used in <a href="http://bitthunder.org/">BitThunder</a>.

FullFAT has had contributions from many people, particularly Hein Tibsoch (Hein__Tibosch) who really helped me
to bring the project up to scratch.
